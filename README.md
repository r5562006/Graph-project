# Graph Project

This project demonstrates the use of a Graph data structure for storing and traversing data. The script provides methods for adding edges, printing the adjacency list, and performing Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/graph_project.git
    cd graph_project
    ```

2. Install the required packages (if any):
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the script to see the Graph in action:
```sh
python graph.py
